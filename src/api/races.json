            "description":"<p>Join your fellow beer loving, life of the party going, over the top underachievers for the <strong>3rd Annual 0.5k<\/strong> in Downtown Huntsville on March 14th - <strong>all to raise money for one very special Gold Star Family.&nbsp;<\/strong>This event is presented by the <strong>Mojo Radio Show and Canvas, Inc<\/strong>. Thank you to our event and sponsor<strong> Miller's Tavern!<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>We know what you're thinking. A 0.5k? How FAR is 0.5k? Do I really HAVE to run? What's REALLY happening?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The course is 0.5k or 0.3 miles or 500 meters, or 1,640.42 feet, or 19,685 inches or something like that. We didn&rsquo;t really measure it. You can walk, skip, leisurely stroll, roller skate, or whatever it takes to cross the finish line. Just make sure you don&rsquo;t spill your beer.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>You have three options for tickets:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #3e5660;\">Baseline tickets are your entry into the race.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #3e5660;\">Sprint the race by registering for the Sprinters Package. We'll cheer you on (aka point and laugh at you) as you take to the course first. This was the most popular kids option in 2019! (hint - register your kids for this family race!!)<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li>Be a VIP and ride the course instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p><strong>Did we mention we&rsquo;re the Official Sponsors of St. Patrick's Day?<br\/><\/strong>The 0.5k conveniently happens to be scheduled on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, so we&rsquo;re claiming the official sponsor rights. What does this mean for you? It means, starting at 9am we&rsquo;re closing off Washington Street between Clinton and North Side Square for a block party like you&rsquo;ve never seen.<\/p>\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll want a party spot to pitch your pre-race and post-race recovery tent, so make sure you register as a Corporate Sponsor to get this perk. Plus, you&rsquo;ll be the only ones that can say &ldquo;meet me at our tent&rdquo; for total St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day shenanigans.<\/p>\r\n<p>The parade goes downtown, (route to be determined), so we&rsquo;ll pause the party happenings for all to watch the parade go by. Keep in mind - as soon as the parade ends we&rsquo;re rolling into serious race prep. So be ready. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>To Recap: (Or something like the agenda below. We&rsquo;re still working out details.)<br\/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Saturday, March 14, 2019<br\/>9:00 am - 11:30 am&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Block Party Shenanigans<br\/>11:30 am - 1:00 pm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Parade Viewing &amp; Block Party Shenanigans<br\/>1:00 pm - 2:00pm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The 0.5k<br\/>2:00 pm - 4:00 pm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Block Party Shenanigans<br\/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>NEW THIS YEAR - FOOD TRUCK RALLY! (Thanks Downtown Huntsville Inc)&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Want to know more? Yeah, we do too. Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re calling Race Details!<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The course is strenuous, but we feel with proper training (hint watch last year's <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/319542230\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">training video)<\/a> <\/span>you&rsquo;ll be able to partake in race day activities. We&rsquo;ll start at the corner of Washington and Clinton Ave, taking a left onto Clinton Holmes, then a left onto Jefferson. This is the toughest stretch &ndash; measuring a whole 200m. To ensure you can make it, we&rsquo;ll have cheerleaders encouraging you along the way. They may just be tourists, but hey you call them what you want. We&rsquo;ll hang a left onto Northside Square before making the final left back onto Washington where you&rsquo;ll see the finish line at the intersection of Washington and North Side Square.<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re estimating it will take you 10 minutes (if you walk like your grandma) to do the course. When you pass through the finish line in a blaze of glory, you'll return to the block party where you&rsquo;ll want to relive the experience, brag to your friends, take selfies to post on social media, &quot;I DID IT!!! I'M A FINISHER!! LOOK AT ME!!!&quot;<\/p>\r\n<p>Conveniently, Miller's has great race day beer specials for your amazing participation.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Still not convinced this is the most epic thing ever? Did we mention&hellip;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bring an extra $$$ for some games, raffles and more&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>You get a T-shirt and medal for showing your friends how awesome you are&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Finish line photos<\/li>\r\n<li>Individual and group costume contests with prizes. Cool sunglasses, leprechaun outfits, leisure suits, pajamas, you name it&hellip;just do it<\/li>\r\n<li>The race is THE OFFICIAL SPONSOR of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day<\/li>\r\n<li>Amazing drink specials at Miller's Tavern (It's like having our own personal bar for the day)<\/li>\r\n<li>Live music<\/li>\r\n<li>Much, much, much more (this is code for as we think of things)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>You want some swag? Then listen up!<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If you want a <strong>T-Shirt<\/strong> on race day - and who doesn't want one of these bad boys - you must <strong>register prior to March 1<\/strong>. Registrations after that are not guaranteed t-shirts.<\/li>\r\n<li>All finishers will receive a pretentious oval Euro-style 0.5k sticker that you can attach to your rear windshield to show everyone what a badass you are.<\/li>\r\n<li>Participation medals (everyone gets recognized for their hard work at this event. We&rsquo;re all about positivity and self-worth.<\/li>\r\n<li>Compete in one of our contests and you&rsquo;ll get awards for your hard work.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>Why are we doing this? &nbsp;To raise money of course.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>We know you think it&rsquo;s all just about beer, and that&rsquo;s cool, but the one thing we aren&rsquo;t making light of is our cause of choice. Every dime we raise will go to support a <strong>North Alabama Gold Star Widow.<\/strong> In case you don&rsquo;t know, the term Gold Star describes a family member who has lost a loved one in military service.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>So now, the part you've been waiting for. How much IS this race??<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Ticket Options:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>$25 &ndash; The Baseline Ticket<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Congratulations you&rsquo;re a part of the most epic thing you will ever do. To reward you for your efforts, you will get a T-Shirt, a 0.5k Sticker, a medal and the feeling of knowing you did something really great for someone else.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>$35 &ndash; The Sprinter&rsquo;s Challenge<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Congratulations you&rsquo;re one step ahead of the rest of us &ndash; you actually like to run. Sure, the Sprinter&rsquo;s Challenge is just a bit more, but that&rsquo;s okay because you&rsquo;re a bit extra anyway. To reward you for your serious athleticism, we&rsquo;re going to let you go first. If you&rsquo;re awesome enough to sprint it, your awesome enough to do it while holding your beer.&nbsp; That isn&rsquo;t s suggestion, but an expectation.<\/p>\r\n<p>The winner of the Sprinter&rsquo;s Challenge will get some serious bragging rights. You will also get a T-Shirt, a 0.5k Sticker, a medal and the feeling of knowing you did something really great for someone else. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>$50 &ndash; The VIP<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Congratulations you&rsquo;re more important than all of us &ndash; you&rsquo;re a VIP. If you like the thought of being ushered in style on the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RocketCityRover\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rocket City Rover Party Bike<\/a><\/span>, then this option is for you! You and 13 of your BFF&rsquo;s (aren't we all BFF's after a few beers??) are going to make history by participating in the race without ever putting your feet to the pavement.<\/p>\r\n<p>In case you noticed, the VIP option is just a tad more, but that&rsquo;s okay because you&rsquo;re really all about supporting a good cause and that alone is worth being a VIP. However, because you&rsquo;re such a VIP, you&rsquo;ll not only get a ride on the <strong>ALL NEW Rocket City Rover,<\/strong> you&rsquo;ll also get a T-Shirt, a 0.5k Sticker, a medal and the feeling of knowing you did something great for someone else.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Give us a donation<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Love what you see but you&rsquo;re super sad you can&rsquo;t make it? Don&rsquo;t worry, this is a fundraiser and you can still participate by clicking the donate button. You'll get the ultimate prize of knowing you did something really great for someone else. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Still have questions? Here's a few answers...<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Is this a family friendly event?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>You bet it is. We all have kids too. The only thing the kids can't do is drink the beer because well that's illegal. In 2019, the kids LOVED taking part in the Sprinter's Challenge. So what are you waiting for? Sign up the whole family! It's for a good cause.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>What is there to do at the block party?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The better question is what isn't there to do!! We'll have all sorts of games and activities, but just to name a few - musical chairs, giant jenga, heads or tails, cornhole, and a whole lot more. We're all about giving things away too, so make sure you register for the good stuff we'll be giving away for game winners. We'll have live music and lots of dancing in the streets.&nbsp;<br\/><br\/>Oh and did we mention FOOD TRUCK RALLY?? I'd bring a chair with you for the day, you're not going to have a reason to leave.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Do I have to pay to come to the block party?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Nope! The block party is open for anyone to partake. You do however have to pay to participate in the 0.5k. You will want to bring some extra $$$ though because this is a fundraiser and we'll be asking for donations! Come prepared to party and give!!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Can I bring my four legged friends?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>If your pups can handle the crowds, we aren't against having them join our shenanigans. Just make sure they don't drink the beer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Still have questions? <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Want to know how to get more involved? Or better yet, do you want to be a sponsor? Send us all your questions. We can&rsquo;t promise we&rsquo;ll know the answer, but we&rsquo;ll promise we&rsquo;ll get back to you.<\/p>",

Find out at the inaugural 1 Mile Marathon Challenge!<\/p>\r\n<p>Teams from 2 to 5 runners will run a full marathon in 1 mile increments on the same out and back 1 mile route. (The course starts at RunStrong HQ, runners then turn around at the marked turnaround spot and return to the start where the next runner from the team will begin their 1 mile leg,&nbsp; The final runner will run 2.2 miles to finish 26.2 total miles.<\/p>\r\n<p>Teams of fewer than 5 runners will be allowed, but 5 is the maximum allowed. Teams may run in any order they choose, but all the run legs must be done on the established course in 1 mile increments.<\/p>\r\n<p>Each participant will receive a race t-shirt and finisher's swag. RunStrong events are as much a social event as a race, and there will be plenty of awesome food and drinks available to participants before, during, and after the event.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The course will start and finish at the RunStrong Training Center and will be a half mile out and half mile back on the paved multi use trail. It will be a challenging course with a couple rolling hills to tackle.<\/p>\r\n<p>Participants will have access to the RunStrong Training Center and the adjacent Iron Sharp facilities to drop gear bags, take showers, and use restrooms.<\/p>\r\n<p>To register, the team captain can create your team during the registration process, and participants registering subsequently can join their team during the registration process. Registration fees will be per participant, not per team, as each participant receives race swag and food.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>There will be awards given for fastest team of each size.&nbsp;<\/p>",

He had run his first 5K with Steps Together so it only seemed fitting that his first marathon be for steps Together. He named his event 100 Laps of Healing and it was a huge success on many levels.&nbsp; The event raised awareness about Steps Together, awareness about the families we help, it also brought our beneficiaries and community together on the track all while raising funds for our organization.<\/p>\r\n<p>2020 will mark the 7th100 Laps of Healing event which has now raised over $30,000 for Steps Together. In 2015, our community came out and walked or ran 5,459 laps or 1,364.75 miles. That's been a record we've been trying to break since that date. &nbsp;<strong>Can you help us in 2020?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>THE EVENT IS FREE!&nbsp;<\/strong>We invite your entire family, all fitness levels, young and old, to come out and be a part of this event.

The 10K race begins at 10,000 ft at the summit of Rabbit Ears Pass. The course begins by heading uphill on USFS dirt roads and 2 track, and then then heads downhill on single-track, ending on a cross country single-track. The total elevation gain and loss are about ~1,200 feet each.<\/p>\r\n<p>*Although this race is listed as a 10k, the actual distance comes out to 6.8 miles. We will have one aid station on the course about 3.4 miles in (the 5k race option does not have an aid station). We HIGHLY recommend that you bring your own water.<\/p>",
